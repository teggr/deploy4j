# deploy4j

Caught between the inspiration of the [MRSK](https://mrsk.dev/) project for deploy web applications and the closure of the heroku free tier the aim of this project is to enable the low cost deployment of (mainly java) web applications onto self hosted VMs such as droplets on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets).
